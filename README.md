# Virtual_Company
Virtual Company is a AI based Virtual Company that can be set up in minutes. The Company features at the possibility to define all roles necessary to reach companies goals and mission. All functions fully automated and AI Based. 

## Suggested improvements
- Add a short architecture overview (core services, data flow, and role orchestration) so contributors know how the AI-driven automation is structured.
- Document a minimal setup/usage example (how to define roles, configure goals/mission, and trigger automation) to make the value proposition tangible.
- Establish basic quality gates (CI workflow with linting/tests) and a small test suite that validates the automated role assignment logic.
- Include security and privacy notes (data storage, model usage, and access control) since automation likely handles sensitive business data.
- Provide a roadmap with 3–5 upcoming milestones (MVP scope, integrations, monitoring/observability) to guide contributions and prioritization.
